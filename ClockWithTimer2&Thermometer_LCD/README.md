## Clock With Internal Timer And Thermometer On LCD Display
  
MCU:        ATmega32  
Frequency:  8MHz  
Display:    16x2 Character LCD
Timer: Internal Timer (Timer2)    
Sensor:     LM35     

Note: Included simulator, schematic and PCB layout with Proteus.  
Note: It's a prototype and should get better. 
Note: It's not usable because when the MCU resets the clock value will be lost.  

Next Tasks:
- [ ] When the day increases or decrease, match it with the calendar
- [ ] Add bypass capacitors in Schematic
- [ ] Edit PCB
- [ ] Add a Buzzer in the Schematic
