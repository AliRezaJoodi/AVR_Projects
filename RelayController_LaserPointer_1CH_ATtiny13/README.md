## 1CH Relay Controller with Laser Pointer And ATtiny13 AVR MicroController
There are one relay and two LDR sensors. One of them activates the relay and the other deactivates it.  

MCU:			ATtiny13    
Frequency:     		4.8MHz

Note: Included schematic and PCB layout with Proteus  
Note: It's a easy project with AVR and was a prototype. Although this made using microcontroller but, it could be done with logic gates.
