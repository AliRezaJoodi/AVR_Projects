MCU:        	ATmega16  
Frequency:  	8MHz  
Display:	128*64 KS108 GLCD  
Timer: 		Internal Timer (Timer2)    
Sensor:     	LM35     

Note: Included simulator, schematic and PCB layout with Proteus.  
Note: It's a prototype and should get better. 
Note: It's not usable because when the MCU resets the clock value will be lost.
